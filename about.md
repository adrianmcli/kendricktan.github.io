Hi! My name is Kendrick. I'm a software developer who has a strong preference for functional languages as programming in this paradigm has helped me strive towards correctness and robustness.

My personal development includes reading papers on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a> to keep me up to date with the latest trends on machine learning, contributing to the blockchain community by writing <a href="https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/zencashjs.git">open sourced libraries</a>, as well as maintaining this technical blog.

Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:kendricktan0814@gmail.com"></i>email</a>. I enjoy emails. And cats. Feel free to follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.miso.oz/">cat on instagram</a>.
