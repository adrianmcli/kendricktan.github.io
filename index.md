Hi! My name is Kendrick. I'm a software developer with a strong preference for functional languages as programming in this paradigm has helped me strive towards correctness and robustness.

Profesionally I'm a fullstack developer with experience in data science/machine learning, blockchain, and DevOps.

My languages of choice are Haskell, JavaScript, and Python.

My current daily driver is a Thinkpad T460s, running XUbuntu with XMonad as my window manager.

Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:me@kndrck.co"></i>email</a>. I enjoy emails. And cats. Feel free to follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.miso.oz/">cat on instagram</a>.
