<div class="content-body">
My name is Kendrick, welcome to my personal website.

Professionally I'm a fullstack developer with experience in data science/machine learning, blockchain, and DevOps. I also have a strong preference for functional languages as programming in this paradigm has helped me strive towards correctness and robustness.

My languages of choice are Haskell, JavaScript, and Python.

My current daily driver is a Thinkpad T460s, running XUbuntu with XMonad as my window manager.

Feel free to send me emails at [`me at kndrck.co`]. I enjoy emails. And cats. Feel free to follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.miso.oz/">cat on instagram</a>.
